# Abusing "remember me" function

An application can provide users with the "remember me" function so that the next authentication from a device does not require to enter the second factor. To implement this functionality, an application can set cookies, save tokens in local storage and/or remember an IP address. In such cases, you need to find out how the "remember me" function is implemented and check if there is any way to spoof it. Try to check the following cases:

1. Is the token stored in the cookie or local storage random?
2. How the token is stored and is it possible to access the token from JavaScript?
3. Is it possible to spoof an IP address using HTTP headers? (see [Abusing IP whitelists](#abusing-ip-whitelists))

# Abusing IP whitelists

An application can "memorizes" the IP address from which a user is authenticated and do not ask for the second factor at further logins. If an application relies on HTTP headers to determine a client's IP address, try to spoof the IP address using the following headers:

# Common cases when using OTP

# Enabling 2FA does not end previously created sessions

{% raw %} {% hint style="info" %} {% endraw %}
This is the best practice to follow
{% raw %} {% endhint %} {% endraw %}

Enabling two-factor authentication should end previously created sessions. If this does not happen, an victim will not have mechanisms for managing the security of their account. As a result, an attacker will be able to maintain an active session for an extended period of time.

# Ignoring 2FA

An application can ignore two-factor authentication when performing actions that can lead to automatic login to an user account.

## Abuse of half-authenticated sessions

An application can issue a session token with limited access after providing credentials. Try to use this session token in an un-enrollment request to disable 2FA. You can check it with the next steps:

1. Submit credentials to an application
2. Catch a session token from the response
3. Stop an authentication on the 2FA step
4. Use the token in a un-enrollment request
5. Login into account without 2FA requirement

## Cross platform applications

The implementation of two-factor authentication for mobile or desktop version of an application may differ from a web one. Two-factor authentication may be weaker or completely absent.

## Disabling 2FA does not require confirmation

If an application does not require an additional confirmation (current password, current OTP, code from SMS, etc.) when disabling two-factor authentication, this provides an option to disable two-factor authentication via CSRF, XSS or Clickjacking attacks.

## Password recovery

An application can automatically log into an account without requiring a second factor after the password recovery process is completed. You can check it with the following steps:

1. Log into an account.
2. Enable two-factor authentication.
3. Go through password recovery.
4. If after changing your password you got into your account without a second factor, an application is vulnerable.

## Sign in with a third-party account

An application can ignore two-factor authentication when logging in through a third-party account, for instance, social networks, Github, Google, etc. You can check it with the following steps:

1. Log into an account.
2. Enable two-factor authentication.
3. Link a third-party account.
4. If logging in through a third-party account does not require a second factor, an application is vulnerable.

## Using staging or old API

If a staging version of an application is publicly available, try logging in with your credentials. In such environments, two-factor authentication can be disabled. Non-production environments can be located on separate domains or subdomains of the main domain, for instance:

- `beta.website.com`
- `stage.website.com`
- `beta-website.com`
- `stagewebsite.com`
- etc.

Additionally check if older API versions are available, they may not require a second factor or not have rate-limit algorithms. If an application supports API versioning, the version can be passed in the URL or HTTP headers, for instance:

- `https://api.website.com/v1/users`
- `https://website.com/api/v1/users`
- `Accept: application/test.data.v1.12+json`
- etc.

# Improper access control to 2FA page

With two-factor authentication, an application can direct a user to a special page using a URL with predefined parameters. If this page can be accessed without cookies or using cookies from another session, you can check the following cases:
- URL generation
- URL expiration date
- Search engine URL indexing

If the URL is guessed, indexed by search engines, has a long expiration date, it can be used to sign in to accounts without entering credentials. Therefore, if there is a way to bypass two-factor authentication, you can access other users account.

# Improper access control to the backup codes

Backup codes are generated immediately after a second factor is enabled and are available only after enabling. For each subsequent request, the codes can be generated anew or remain unchanged.

Try to find a vulnerability that could steal backup codes from a response to a request to backup code display endpoint.

# Mixing 2FA modes

An application can provide multiple 2FA modes, such as SMS- and TOTP-based 2FA processes. If an application uses a per-user unique parameter other than a half-authenticated session cookie to refer to the desired 2FA mode, you can try to complete an authentication process with your 2FA mode that is not used by a victim. An example of an attack flow might contains the next steps:

1. Victim set up SMS-based 2FA
2. Attacker enrolls in 2FA using an authenticator app (TOTP-based 2FA) and saves their unique parameter, for instance `factor_id`
3. Attacker enters a victim's email address and password
4. If the password is correct, an attacker's browser is sent a new authentication cookie and redirects to `/mfa/sms/verification`
5. Attacker does not follow the redirect to the SMS verification form. Instead, attacker sends their `factor_id` and code from the authenticator app with victim's half-authenticated cookie to TOTP verification endpoint: `/mfa/totp/verification` endpoint.

# Session persistence to the 2FA flow

Typically, an authentication flow initializes a session after creds have been passed and waits for a second factor to complete the flow. Try to change password/disable 2FA in this step and complete the authentication flow. If the session does not time out or you can renew it yourself (for example by changing the authentication way) and an app allows you to login, you can still access the user account even after changing password/disabling 2FA.

An example of an attack might look as follows:

1. An attacker gains access to a victim's account that does not have 2FA.
2. The attacker enables 2FA for the victim's account.
3. In another browser, the attacker stops after passing creds and waits indefinitely at this step.
4. The attacker disables 2FA for the victim's account.
5. The victim regains access to the account and changes password/resets sessions.
6. The attacker completes the flow with 2FA and gain access to the account again.
